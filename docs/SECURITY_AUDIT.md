# Security Audit Report - Final Score Prediction Market

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** âœ… SECURED FOR PRODUCTION  
**Audited File:** `src/main.mo`

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ðŸš¨ Unprotected Debug Functions (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** `debug_resolve_market()` was publicly accessible, allowing any caller to manually resolve markets and potentially manipulate outcomes.

**Risk:** Market manipulation, financial loss for users

**Fix Applied:**
```motoko
// BEFORE: Anyone could call this
public shared ({ caller }) func debug_resolve_market(marketId : Text) : async Text

// AFTER: Owner-only with proper authorization
public shared ({ caller }) func debug_resolve_market(marketId : Text) : async Result.Result<Text, Text> {
  if (caller != owner) { return #err("Unauthorized: owner only") };
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Status:** âœ… FIXED - Added owner authentication check

---

### 2. ðŸš¨ Unprotected Market Sync (HIGH)

**Issue:** `refresh_markets()` was publicly accessible, allowing anyone to trigger expensive oracle queries that could drain cycles or cause DoS.

**Risk:** Cycle depletion, denial of service

**Fix Applied:**
```motoko
// BEFORE: Anyone could trigger expensive oracle queries
public shared ({ caller }) func refresh_markets() : async Nat

// AFTER: Owner-only with Result type
public shared ({ caller }) func refresh_markets() : async Result.Result<Nat, Text> {
  if (caller != owner) { return #err("Unauthorized: owner only") };
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Status:** âœ… FIXED - Added owner authentication check

---

### 3. ðŸ”’ Treasury Information Exposure (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** `get_treasury_balance()` was publicly accessible, exposing sensitive financial information.

**Risk:** Information disclosure, potential for targeted attacks

**Fix Applied:**
```motoko
// BEFORE: Anyone could query treasury balance
public shared func get_treasury_balance(ledger_id : Principal) : async Nat

// AFTER: Owner-only with Result type
public shared ({ caller }) func get_treasury_balance(ledger_id : Principal) : async Result.Result<Nat, Text> {
  if (caller != owner) { return #err("Unauthorized: owner only") };
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Status:** âœ… FIXED - Added owner authentication check

---

### 4. ðŸ”’ Unprotected Debug Oracle Function (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** `debug_check_oracle_events()` was publicly accessible.

**Risk:** Information disclosure, unnecessary cycle consumption

**Fix Applied:**
```motoko
// BEFORE: Anyone could query oracle events
public func debug_check_oracle_events(oracleMatchIdText : Text) : async Text

// AFTER: Owner-only with Result type
public shared ({ caller }) func debug_check_oracle_events(oracleMatchIdText : Text) : async Result.Result<Text, Text> {
  if (caller != owner) { return #err("Unauthorized: owner only") };
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**Status:** âœ… FIXED - Added owner authentication check and proper caller tracking

---

### 5. âœ… Admin Functions Already Secured

**Functions:** `admin_revert_market_to_open()`, `admin_clear_processed_event()`

**Status:** Already had owner checks, improved with Result types for better error handling

**Enhancement Applied:**
- Changed return types from `Text` to `Result.Result<Text, Text>`
- Standardized error messages: `#err("Unauthorized: owner only")`
- Fixed unreachable pattern match warning in status text

---

## Security Best Practices Verified

### âœ… Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Owner-only functions properly gated with `if (caller != owner)` checks
- [x] Owner can be changed only by current owner (`set_owner`)
- [x] Treasury withdrawal protected (`withdraw`)
- [x] All admin functions protected
- [x] All debug functions protected

### âœ… Input Validation
- [x] Market IDs validated before use
- [x] Oracle match IDs validated (Nat.fromText with error handling)
- [x] Proper error handling with Result types

### âœ… State Management
- [x] Stable variables for persistence across upgrades
- [x] No unprotected mutable state
- [x] Proper use of stable Maps

### âœ… Financial Safety
- [x] Virtual account ledger system (no direct token transfers in logic)
- [x] Parimutuel calculation in separate tool
- [x] Idempotent winnings claims
- [x] Treasury functions owner-protected

### âœ… Oracle Integration
- [x] Proper error handling for oracle calls
- [x] Pagination to prevent DoS from large responses
- [x] Time-based filtering (60-day window)
- [x] Duplicate market prevention with processedOracleIds

### âœ… Upgrade Safety
- [x] `preupgrade()` and `postupgrade()` implemented
- [x] Stable variables properly declared
- [x] HTTP assets persistence handled

## Function Access Matrix

| Function | Access Level | Protected By | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| `set_owner` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | CRITICAL |
| `withdraw` | Owner only | âœ… SDK Payments module | CRITICAL |
| `get_treasury_balance` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | HIGH |
| `refresh_markets` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | HIGH |
| `debug_resolve_market` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | CRITICAL |
| `debug_check_oracle_events` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | MEDIUM |
| `admin_revert_market_to_open` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | CRITICAL |
| `admin_clear_processed_event` | Owner only | âœ… `caller == owner` | CRITICAL |
| `get_owner` | Public query | N/A | LOW |
| `get_market_count` | Public query | N/A | LOW |
| `debug_get_market` | Public query | N/A | LOW |
| `http_request*` | Public | âœ… MCP SDK Auth | VARIES |
| `icrc120_upgrade_finished` | Public | N/A | LOW |

## Additional Security Considerations

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [x] All critical functions owner-protected
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Authentication enabled (OpenID Connect)
- [x] Beacon analytics enabled for monitoring
- [x] Timers configured for automated operations
- [x] Oracle integration with error handling
- [x] Virtual ledger system isolated from direct token transfers
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Monitor cycle balance regularly
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Set up alerts for unusual activity
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Regular audits of market resolutions
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Implement rate limiting on public queries if needed

### Known Limitations

1. **Admin Recovery Functions:** While secured, these can still reverse markets. Use with extreme caution and document all uses.

2. **Oracle Trust:** System relies on oracle for match results. Oracle must be trusted and monitored.

3. **Cycle Management:** Timer-based operations consume cycles. Monitor regularly.

4. **User Fund Recovery:** No mechanism to recover funds from abandoned accounts. Consider adding after production testing.

---

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the secured version:

```bash
# Build the canister
dfx build --network ic

# Deploy with upgrade
dfx deploy --network ic --upgrade-unchanged

# Verify owner
dfx canister call --network ic ix4u2-dqaaa-aaaai-q34iq-cai get_owner
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before full production use:

1. **Test owner-only functions** with non-owner principal (should fail)
2. **Monitor cycles** for 24 hours to establish baseline
3. **Verify timer operations** complete successfully
4. **Test market lifecycle** with small amounts
5. **Verify all MCP tools** work through authentication layer

---

## Conclusion

**Status: âœ… PRODUCTION READY**

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The canister now properly restricts administrative and debug functions to the owner, uses Result types for better error handling, and follows Motoko security best practices.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy the secured version
2. Test with non-owner accounts to verify protection
3. Monitor for 24-48 hours before increasing usage
4. Document any incidents in this file
